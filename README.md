## Sentiment Analysis Using BERT
This repository demonstrates the implementation of a sentiment analysis model using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art NLP model. The project focuses on classifying IMDb movie reviews into positive and negative sentiments.

# Features
# Data Preprocessing:
Cleans and tokenizes textual data using tools like BeautifulSoup and Hugging Face's BERT tokenizer.
# Model Training:
Fine-tunes the BERT model for sequence classification using the IMDb dataset.
# Evaluation: 
Generates performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Visualization: 
Includes word clouds and interactive plots for data analysis and results interpretation.
# Dataset
The project uses the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset, which contains 50,000 reviews categorized as positive or negative. The dataset is automatically downloaded and extracted during runtime.

## Installation
# Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Additionally, install the following libraries: 
pip install tensorflow transformers pandas matplotlib plotly wordcloud scikit-learn beautifulsoup4

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-using-bert.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd sentiment-analysis-using-bert

Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook Sentiment_analysis_using_BERT.ipynb

Execute the cells step-by-step to: Download and preprocess the dataset.
Fine-tune the BERT model.
Evaluate the results and generate visualizations.

## Results
The fine-tuned BERT model achieves high accuracy on the IMDb dataset.

Word clouds highlight the most common words in positive and negative reviews.

Performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, provide insights into the model's effectiveness.

## Future Enhancements
Explore other transformer models like RoBERTa or DistilBERT.

Extend the project to handle multi-class sentiment classification.

Implement a web interface for real-time sentiment analysis.
